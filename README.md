# ROS_odometer_computation--MonzaTrack
It is a basic project of ROS to compute the odometry and vehicle motion in a real world. The first node of the trajetory was not always perfect because of incorrected steering factor and datas, but we could obtain an ideal track in the second node. Additionally, it is also interesting to fine-tune those parameters by referencing them in GPS.
